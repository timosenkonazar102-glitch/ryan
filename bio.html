    <h2>Early Life and Family</h2>
    <p>Ryan Thomas Gosling was born into a middle-class Canadian family. His father, Thomas Gosling, worked as a traveling salesman, while his mother, Donna Gosling, was a secretary. The family were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and Ryan later stated that religion strongly influenced his upbringing, instilling discipline and independence.
                                 Because of his father’s job, the family moved frequently, which made it difficult for Ryan to form long-term friendships. He experienced bullying at school and struggled academically and socially. Eventually, his mother decided to homeschool him, a decision that allowed him to focus more on creative interests. From an early age, Ryan showed a strong passion for music, dance, and performance.</p>

    <h2>Early Career</h2>
    <p>At the age of 12, Gosling successfully auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club (1993–1995), a popular Disney Channel television show. He performed alongside future stars such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake. This experience became his first professional training ground in entertainment.

After leaving the show, Gosling continued acting in television series and family-oriented films, including Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Goosebumps, Breaker High, and Young Hercules. Although these roles kept him working steadily, they did not yet bring him major recognition.</p>

    <h2>Transition to Serious Acting</h2>
    <p> In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Gosling made a deliberate effort to distance himself from his image as a child actor. His breakthrough dramatic role came in "The Believer" (2001), in which he portrayed a Jewish neo-Nazi. The performance was widely praised and demonstrated his willingness to take on psychologically complex and controversial roles, earning him critical attention.</p>

    <h2>Breakthrough and Worldwide Fame</h2>
    <p>Gosling achieved international fame in 2004 with the romantic drama "The Notebook" , where he played Noah Calhoun. The film became a cultural phenomenon and established him as a leading man and romantic icon.
Rather than continuing exclusively in romantic roles, Gosling chose challenging and unconventional projects. His performance in Half Nelson (2006), as a middle-school teacher struggling with drug addiction, earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.</p>
